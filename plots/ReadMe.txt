Here we provide some example Jupyter notebooks to analyse the GA chains. As an example, we provide the scripts for the unbinned data:
1) "plots.ipynb": Analyses the chains and finds the best-fit potential, its chi^2 etc. Also makes the related plots.
2) "Cls_residuals_1.ipynb": Plots the Cl residuals of the best-fit potential with respect to the prior, using the Planck data.
3) "features_plots.ipynb": Find the frequencies of features in the data.
